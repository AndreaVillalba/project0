              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p> This software is capable to distinguish the maturation state of a plantain: ripe, green or damaged. The result is calculated by uploading a picture to the web app. Our long-term goal is to involve this type of software in industrial processes in order to automate the classification process.
              </p>

              <p>The classification software was created with python, using libraries like Tensorflow and OpenCv, which help us to train the convolutional network. After this was done, we uploaded the trained model to a web application that was developed using Flask, HTML and CSS.</p>

              <h3>Kickoff</h3>
              <p>This project started at April of 2019. It was separated into 3 phases, the first one consisted in the recolection of images that will be part of the dataset. During the second phase the predictive neural network was created and at last the connection to the web application was established.</p>
                
                
               <p> In the early phase, we encounter a problem that there were not enough plantain images images on the internet, for this reason the pictures that we used were taking by our team. Later on we took 650 images of each maduration state, so in total our dataset had almost 2000 images. </p>

              <p>
                The second phase started once the dataset was created, and it consisted in creating a predictive classification program using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). We first had to label the images using numbers, so after this was done we where able to train at least 8 different models so we can find the most accurate one. The most accurate model was the one that had 2 convolutions, used 256 neurons in each layer and did not use any dense layer in addition to the last one.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the end, the most accurate model was saved. A web application was developed using Flask, in order to  allow the user interact with the model.</p>


                <p>
                The final result allows the user upload a picture of a plantain, getting as response a final prediction: ripe, mature or damaged.

              <h3>Key challenges</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The accumulation of the correct ammount of pictures was not easy, as we had to take at least 2000 pictures in order to create a model that actually learn. The picture had to meet certain conditions: various angles, different lighting and the same background color (white). </li>

                <li>The testing period was longer than expected as the training of each of the 8 models required a lot of resources and time.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Key results</h3>
              <p><span class="accu">An accuracy of 96%</span> was achieved (see the confussion matrix below). While testing, the model mistaknely predicted 23 images where the most common error was classifying green platains as ripped, in 18 different occations. A 100% accuracy was achieved while classifying the damaged plantains.  </p>
             
                <p>This project was finalist of national Science Fair, celebrated in Panama City, Panama. </p>
