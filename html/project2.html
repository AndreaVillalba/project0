              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model using big data in order to predict how many people won't show to a flight. The model that presented the smallest percentage of error Random Forest. The aplication needs the following data in order to make the prediction: </p>

              
              <ul>
                <li class="p2">Hour of the flight</li>
                <li class="p2">Weekday (in a number from 1 to 7)</li>
                <li class="p2">Day of the flight(number)</li>
                <li class="p2">Month of the flight (number)</li>
                <li class="p2">Year of the flight</li>
                <li class="p2">Total capacity of the airpline</li>
                <li class="p2">Origin (capital letter)</li>
                <li class="p2">Final destination (capital letter)</li>

              <p>
               As we only had 24h to complete this project we were able online to create a prototype of the application that was supposed to connect with the trained model.

              <h3>Experience</h3>
              <p>When this experience started we had no idea how would it be, so everything was a complete surprise for us. When the 24h countdown began, our first goal was to have clean data. To accomplish this, we began to graph data that could be related to each other, in this way we were able to locate outliers in a very fast way. After this analysis, we proceeded to erase many rows that had missing values or outliers. This process took us approximately 5 hours.</p>

              <p>Once our data was clean enough, we proceeded to prepare it for the training. So we erase those columns that were not important to determine if a person would show up or not. The next step was to replace the data that contained strings with numbers because to train correctly it is important to have quantitative data. </p>

              <p>Then the time of training arrived, we first trained using a regression model but the percentage error was high, so we tried with classification but the same happened. At this point, we decided to give it a try to neural networks, but it was taking so much time that we decided to stop it. In the end, we found the best model, using a random forest regressor. </p>

              <p>It was 3 am and the final presentation would start at 8 am, so we decided to present a more visual solution, by doing a mobile prototype. </p>

              <p>At the end, all this effort was worth it since we were among the last 3 finalists </p>
